# Data Visualization

This exam consisted of a written test and a project on the main topics of the course.

The project, carried out together with my colleagues **Matteo Anedda**, **Greta Gravina** and **Giada Palazzo**, consists in the study and the visualization of the correlations between the result of the Italian political elections of 4 March 2018 and the influence of the press, understood as social interactions and most clicked sites and news.

The project was carried out using both **Python** and the **Tableau** platform, combining everything in a single tableau public dashboard.

Check out the visualization here (use a PC or a laptop): https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/niccol.3340/viz/Linfluenzadellastampaitalianasulrisultatodel4Marzo/Titolo.

Final grade: **27**.

Furthermore, there is a png file containing an **optional** visualization carried out individually during the course.
